- Start Date: 2019-04-29
- Target Major Version: Vue (2.x / 3.x) Vue Router (3.x / 4.x)
- Reference Issues: https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/issues/2611,
- Implementation PR: Implemented in both [v3.x](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/commit/e289ddee99fcc3129e65485e32f394c1308bb98b) and v4.x

# Summary

- Remove `tag` prop
- Remove `event` prop
- Stop automatically assigning click events to inner anchors
- Add a scoped-slot API

# Basic example

```vue
<router-link to="/">
  <Icon>home</Icon> Home
</router-link>
```

# Motivation

Current implementation of Router Link has many limitations:

- Active state customization is not complete ([#2611](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/issues/2611)
- Cannot be integrated with custom components ([#2021](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/issues/2021))
- click event cannot be prevented (through `@click.prevent` nor through a `disabled` attribute [#2098](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/pull/2098))

The idea of this RFC is to solve those issues by providing a scoped slot that allow app developers to easily extend Links based on their applications and to allow library authors to provide an even easier integration with Vue Router.

# Detailed design

## Slot with content

A simple use case would be slot with content (no nested anchors or buttons)

```vue
<router-link to="/">
  <Icon>home</Icon> Home
</router-link>
```

This implementation would:

- generate an anchor (`a`) element and apply the corresponding properties:
  - `href` with the destination
  - `class` with `router-link-active` and/or `router-link-exact-active` (can be changed through prop or global option)
  - click listener to trigger navigation through `router.push` or `router.replace` with a `event.preventDefault` (except when the link is clicked using a modifier like <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>)
- Put anything passed as the children of the anchor
- Pass down any attributes that aren't props to the `a` element

**Breaking changes**:

- no longer accept a `tag` prop -> use the scoped slot instead (see the point below)
- no longer accepts `event` -> use the scoped slot instead
- no longer works as a wrapper automatically looking for the first `a` inside -> use the scoped slot instead

## Custom `tag` prop

I am not sure about keeping the `tag` prop if it can be replaced which a scoped slot because it wouldn't handle custom components and except for very simple cases, we will likely use custom UI components instead of the basics ones:

```vue
<router-link to="/" tag="button">
  <Icon>home</Icon><span class="xs-hidden">Home</span>
</router-link>
```

is equivalent to

```vue
<router-link to="/" v-slot="{ navigate, isActive, isExactActive }">
  <button role="link" @click="navigate" :class="{ active: isActive, 'exact-active': isExactActive }">
    <Icon>home</Icon><span class="xs-hidden">Home</span>
  </button>
</router-link>
```

(see below for explanation about the attributes passed to the scoped-slot)

## Scoped slot

A scoped slot would get access to every bit of information needed to provide a custom integration and allows applying the active classes, click listener, links, etc at any level. This would allow a better integration with frameworks like Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/navbar/). The idea would be to create a Vue component to avoid the boilerplate like bootstrap-vue does (https://bootstrap-vue.js.org/docs/components/navbar/#navbar)

```vue
<router-link to="/" v-slot="{ href, navigate, isActive }">
  <li :class="{ 'active': isActive }">
    <a :href="href" @click="navigate">
      <Icon>home</Icon><span class="xs-hidden">Home</span>
    </a>
  </li>
</router-link>
```

### Accessible variables

The slot should provide values that are computed inside `router-link`:

- `href`: resolved relative url to be added to an anchor tag (contains the base if provided while route.fullPath doesn't)
- `route`: resolved normalized route location from the `to` (same shape as `$route`)
- `navigate`: function to trigger navigation (usually attached to a click). Also calls `preventDefault` if the click is directly pressed.
- `isActive`: true whenever `router-link-active` is applied. Can be modified by `exact` prop
- `isExactActive`: true whenever `router-link-exact-active` is aplied. Can be modified by `exact` prop.

# Drawbacks

- Whereas it's possible to keep existing behaviour working and only expose a new behaviour with scoped slots, it will still prevent us from fixing existing issues with current implementation. That's why there are some breaking changes, to make things more consistent.
- No access to the default `router-link` classes like `router-link-active` and `router-link-exact-active`.

# Alternatives

- Keeping `event` prop for convienience

# Adoption strategy

- Document new slot behaviour based on examples
- Deprecate `tag` and `event` with a message and link to documentation the remove in v4

# Unresolved questions
